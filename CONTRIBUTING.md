Issues are very valuable to this project.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are, a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

When deciding if I merge in a pull request I look at the following things:

### Does it state intent

You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your contribution.

For example:

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md

Doesn't tell me anything about why you're doing that

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md because users don't always look in the CONTRIBUTING.md

Tells me the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows me the action you have taken to solve it.

### Is it of good quality

* There are no spelling mistakes
* It reads well



### Does it move this repository closer to my vision for the repository

The aim of this repository is:

* To provide a simple implementaions of codes with time complexites on the go, anyone can copy and paste, into their project
* The content is usable by someone who hasn't written something like this before
* Foster a culture of respect and gratitude in the open source community.
