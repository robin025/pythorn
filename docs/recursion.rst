Recursion
=========


Quick Start Guide
------------------

``stack`` :- Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).


A stack allows access to only one data item: the last item inserted. If you remove this item, you can access the next-to-last item inserted, and so on.


A stack is also a handy aid for algorithms applied to certain complex data structures. In "Binary Trees", weâ€™ll see it used to help traverse the nodes of a tree.


Notice how the order of the data is reversed. Because the last item pushed is the first one popped.


commonly implemented with linked lists but can be made from arrays too.


operations of stack: pop(), push(), tos(), isEmpty(), display().
